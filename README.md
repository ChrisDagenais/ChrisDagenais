- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisDagenais
- 👀 I’m interested in fire modeling using FDS.
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching fire safety in buildings to undergraduate and graduate students, with an end-term project related to FDS modeling (simple to intermediate models).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design examples for my students, as well as technical support to debug my own models.
- 📫 How to reach me: chrisdagenais@yahoo.com
